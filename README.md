## Remove duplicate files

The `awk` part initializes `lasthash` with the empty string, which will not match any hash, and then checks for each line if the hash in `lasthash` is the same as the hash (first column) of the current file (second column). 
If it is, it prints it out. At the end of every step it will set `lasthash` to the hash of the current file. 
The filenames `awk` spits out are fed to `rm` with `xargs`, which basically calls `rm` with what the `awk` part gives us.

üêß:
```bash
md5sum * | sort | awk 'BEGIN{lasthash = ""} $1 == lasthash {print $2} {lasthash = $1}' | xargs rm
```
üçè:
```bash
md5 -r * | sort | awk 'BEGIN{lasthash = ""} $1 == lasthash {print $2} {lasthash = $1}' | xargs rm
```
